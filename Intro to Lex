What is Lex?
->  Lex is a tool for lexical analysis.
    You define patterns (regular expressions) that match parts of the input.
    And for each match, Lex executes some code you specify.

Structure of a Lex Program:
->  A Lex program consists of three sections:
    1. Definition Section: Declare variables and include headers like #include <stdio.h>.
    2. Rules Section: Define patterns and corresponding actions.
    3. User Code Section: Write supporting code like the main() function.
